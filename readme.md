Reproducible research "Peer assignments"
=========================

This repo contains answers to Coursera's [Reproducible research](https://www.coursera.org/course/repdata/) course assignments, taught by John Hopkins School of Public Health.

- There is an assignment where one must write a report that answers some questions. It's basically an assignment to learn about Rmd (R markdown)

- On the second assignment one must explore the NOAA Storm Database and answer some basic questions about severe weather events. It's an assignment to gain practice with the RPubs platform and, again, with the R markdown format.
